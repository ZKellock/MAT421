        "## Introduction to the Problem / Research Objective:\n",
        "\n",
        "Temperature data is an essential part in areas such as climate research, weather forecasting, and environmental analysis. However, many major temperature datasets have missing values due to machine errors, sensor malfunctions, or data transmission issues. Being able to accuratrely predict these missing values is crucial to maintaining reliability and consistency in temperature data. This project aims to use various interpolation strategies to estimate missing temperature values in the NOAA Surface Temperature Data and compare the interpolated results to determine which method is most accurate to fill in the gaps in temperature records.\n",
